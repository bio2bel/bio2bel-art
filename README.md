# The bio2bel Logo

## Usage Guidelines and Information
Feel free to use the bio2bel logos to represent the use of bio2bel in your projects.

The text in the bio2bel logos is set in Bauhaus 93 with manual kerning and adjustments. Some SVG versions of the logos may have the text converted to paths to allow display on a wider variety of systems.

Approximately 30% whitespace should be left around the logo.

Inverting the colors of the logos may be appropriate to match with the context in which the logo is being displayed. However, please do not recolor, stretch, skew, or otherwise modify the logos when using them to represent the bio2bel project.

When mentioned in text, the project name should be styled as bio2bel, with no uppercase letters. Generally, write the name in plain text instead of embedding the logo inline.

The bio2bel logos were created as vector graphics in Inkscape and rasterized to PNG with Inkscape as well. The PNG versions were then [optimized](https://blog.codinghorror.com/zopfli-optimization-literally-free-bandwidth/) using `optipng` and `advdef`:
```sh
optipng -o2 -nb *.png && advdef -z -4 *.png
```
